Tic Tac Toe Game

## Getting Started
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game developed by myself as a  self-taught Flutter developer as  first Flutter project. As a beginner, I am incredibly proud of this achievement. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a line of three of their own symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It's a fun and classic game that showcases my progress in learning Flutter and building interactive applications. Feel free to give it a try and enjoy the game!
